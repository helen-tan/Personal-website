# A Website to Introduce Myself

Hello! This project is a personal website that I have worked on as a capstone project of a Web App course conducted by Smart Academy.
It is built with a Glitch Progressive Web App (PWA) starter kit is based on the `hello-express` project in Glitch and files from [Google PWA CodeLabs][1]. 

Consists of a server that serves a webpage, its resources, and some data.

To create a new Glitch project from this starter kit, go to `Glitch.com > New Project > Import from Github`, and then
enter the URL of this repository.

## Your Project

On the front-end,

- Add new html files in the `public/` folder
- `public/scripts/client.js` is the javacript that runs when you load the webpage
- `public/style.css` is the styles for the html pages
- Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,

- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy.
